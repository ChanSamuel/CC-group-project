 * 	-Generate data to represent the state of the world after each update. ("Ticks") -> [can be used by renderer and recorder and persistence modules]
 * 	-Restore a game state from a level + tick (To facilitate loading saved games)
 * 	-Expose public API methods to simulate the game { update(...), moveChip(...), getState(...), loadObject(...), loadLevel() }
