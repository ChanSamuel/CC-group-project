Adding an entity to the board needs to be registered In the tick to cover 
for the scenario where a player spawns on a collectible item. //TODO

Before we call object.update() on the next object, we need to make a new currentEvent MultiMove
to start appending to

Everytime an actual physical move occurs //TODO
We need to append it to the currentEvent MultiMove Command

After an object has finished updating [object.update() returns], we need to save
the currentEvent command to the current Tick's list of event commands

TO DO -> how to handle terrain updates?
>> I think we need to save the terrain that we are moving to each time along with 'us'
>> then the terrain command can remember 
	the terrain before the update
	the object that caused the update
>> undo -> Tile.setTerrain(beforeTerrain)
>> redo -> Tile.setTerrain(beforeTerrain.next(mover))
